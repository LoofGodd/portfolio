        My initial year was 2020 at RUPP which was a covid event.{" "}
        <span className="underline text-white">First-year</span>, completely on
        virtual class, It was hard to adapt my self into this situation but this
        made my researching skill a bit to another level.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Second-year, virtual class took another first semester and second
        semester they decided allowing students studied in physical class which
        brought everyone&apos;s happiness, especially students who is BacII exam
        bypassðŸ˜„. At that time, We have a team(4 members) and I&apos;m the
        lead(cuz they voted). we did some academic projects together such{" "}

        <span className="text-white underline">Third-year,</span> Again! Virtual
